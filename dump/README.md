## shit that needs to be installed manually still even though its nix
1. doom emacs
   - nix-doom-emacs is broken so you have to install it manually
   - from [doomemacs/doomemacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#install)
``` sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
```
