# pumpnnix

my pumpndump but now im moving it to home manager cause why not

## non declarative stuff

1. doom emacs
   - _should_ automatically install using `home-manager switch`, you just need
     to invoke `doom env` and check up on `doom doctor` if theres anything wrong

     ```bash
     doom env
     ```

2. browsers firefox
   - you gotta reinstall the extension setttings from [./home/dump/firefox_extension_settings/]
   - sync the browser using firefox cause i love being tracked (but mainly because you really can't beat it)

3. Redownload and setup some wallpapers or something
   - [Distrotube](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers)
   - Rosepine ([1](https://github.com/rose-pine/wallpapers), [2](https://wallhaven.cc/tag/162505), or just [google](https://www.google.com/search?q=rose+pine+wallpaper&tbs=imgo:1&udm=2) [it](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&q=rose+pine+wallpaper&ia=images&iax=images))
   - [Wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc/)
   - [Gruvbox](https://gruvbox-wallpapers.pages.dev/)
   - maybe not cause its goonna fetch the wallpaper for you anyway using stylix.nix
