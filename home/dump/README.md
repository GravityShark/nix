# pumpnnix

my pumpndump but now im moving it to home manager cause why not

## shit that needs to be installed manually still even though its nix

1. doom emacs
   - [nix-doom-emacs](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-doom-emacs) is broken so you have to install it manually
   - from [doomemacs/doomemacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#install)

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
```

2. browsers firefox
   you gotta reinstall the extension setttings from [./home/dump/firefox_extension_settings/]

3. syncthing a lil funky tbh
