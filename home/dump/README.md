# pumpnnix

my pumpndump but now im moving it to home manager cause why not

## shit that needs to be installed manually still even though its nix

1. doom emacs

   - _should_ automatically install using `home-manager switch`, you just need
     to invoke `doom env` and check up on `doom doctor` if theres anything wrong

     ```bash
     doom env
     ```

2. browsers firefox
   you gotta reinstall the extension setttings from [./home/dump/firefox_extension_settings/]
