## Sync and Extensions

1. Connect to sync
2. Look at the other files in this folder and import to the respective extension
3. For keepassxc browser extension, you would have to manually turn off the
   symlink first, manually enable browser intgeration in the keepassxc gui
   (with the selected browser). open up the browser and connect the database in
   Keepassxc-Browser > Connected Databases, then connect it. After put the
   symlink back on
