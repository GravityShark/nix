  # These will be explicitly sourced when using a shell provided by
  # Home Manager. If you don't want to manage your shell through Home Manager
  # then you have to manually source 'hm-session-vars.sh' located at either
  #
  #  ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
  # or
  #  ~/.local/state/nix/profiles/profile/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh
  # or
  #  /etc/profiles/per-user/gravity/etc/profile.d/hm-session-vars.sh

  # This value determines the Home Manager release that your configuration is
  # compatible with. This helps avoid breakage when a new Home Manager release
  # introduces backwards incompatible changes.
